                <h3>As a motivated and driven individual, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to 

                    challenge myself and grow both personally and professionally. My name is Krishna Keshab Banik and I am 
                    
                    currently pursuing a <u>Btech degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial
                    
                    Intelligence and Machine Learning</u> at SRM University in Chennai.
                    
                    
                    
                    My passion for technology and problem solving has led me to choose a career path in the field of 
                    
                    <u>Artificial Intelligence</u>. I believe that with the right use of AI, we can solve complex problems and
                    
                    contribute to the development of society. I am always eager to learn and explore new techniques and 
                    
                    technologies in this ever-evolving field.
                        
                    
                    
                    Having completed my schooling from <u>Indus Valley World School</u> in Kolkata, I have developed a strong
                    
                    foundation in academics and extracurricular activities. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance
                    
                    my skills and gain practical experience in the industry.
                        
                    
                    
                    Apart from my academic pursuits, I am a huge cricket fan. I believe that sports teach us important 
                    
                    lessons such as teamwork, determination, and discipline, which are essential for personal and
                    
                    professional growth.
                        
                    
                    
                    I am now looking forward to working on innovative and challenging projects that will allow me to apply 
                    
                    my knowledge and skills in a practical setting. I am confident that my problem-solving abilities, 
                    
                    coupled with my passion for technology, will enable me to achieve more in life.</h3>
